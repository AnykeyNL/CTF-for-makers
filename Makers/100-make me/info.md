Make the puzzle and find the flag. 

Form the flag from the letters/numbers from top to bottom.

You will find files for:
- 3D Printing (.stl + .pdf)
-  Lasercutting (.ai / .eps / .svg )
-  Paper printing  + scissors or figuurzagen (.pdf)
-  On screen (.ppt)

If you 3D print, also print out .PDF for underlay of frame.

## Hints
- It is not a plane... it's a bird! (crane bird)
- the 4 words under the wings form the flag. Enter them in any order with or without spaces.
- Make sure the eyes are in the head of the bird!
